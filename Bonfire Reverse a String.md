# Details
- Difficulty: 1/5

Reverse the provided string.

You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.

Your result must be a string.

Remember to use [ Read-Search-Ask](http://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/How-to-get-help-when-you-get-stuck) if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

## Problem Script:

```
function reverseString(str) {
  return str;
}

reverseString('hello');
```

## Explanation:
This is very simple, they just want you to get familiar with how their Bonfires work.

## Hint: 1
Read details.

## Hint: 2
Did you read all the details?

## Hint: 3
You need to change the return statement to what they ask.

## My code:

```
function meetBonfire(argument) {
  // Good luck!
  console.log("you can read this function's argument in the developer tools", argument);

  return true;
}

meetBonfire("You can do this!");
```

## My Code Explanation:
All you had to do was change from false to true.
