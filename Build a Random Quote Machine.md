## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: [Random Quotes Rewritten](http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/full/vEoVMw).

## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
1. As a user, I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
2. As a user, I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Notes:
Note that you can either put your quotes into an array and show them at random, or use an API to get quotes, such as [http://forismatic.com/en/api/](http://forismatic.com/en/api/).
