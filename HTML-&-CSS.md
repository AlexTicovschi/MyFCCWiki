## Say Hello to HTML Elements
HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:

`<tagname>content</tagname>` The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

`<p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>`

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>. Closing tags look like this: </h1>`  Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

## Headline with the h2 Element
You can create different levels of Heading elements by using h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 which will result on different sizes.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2> CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

## Inform with the Paragraph Element
**p** elements are the preferred element for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. P is short for "paragraph".

You can create a p element like so: `<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

## Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

You can start a comment with `<!-- and end a comment with -->`.

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

## Comment out HTML
Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!-- and to end a comment, you need to use -->.`

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

## Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. It's called lorem ipsum text because those are the first two words of a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
