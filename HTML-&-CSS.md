## Say Hello to HTML Elements
HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:

`<tagname>content</tagname>` The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

`<p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>`

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>. Closing tags look like this: </h1>`  Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.

## Headline with the h2 Element
You can create different levels of Heading elements by using h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 which will result on different sizes.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2> CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

## Inform with the Paragraph Element
**p** elements are the preferred element for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. P is short for "paragraph".

You can create a p element like so: `<p>I'm a p tag!</p>`.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

## Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

You can start a comment with `<!-- and end a comment with -->`.

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

## Comment out HTML
Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!-- and to end a comment, you need to use -->.`

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

## Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. It's called lorem ipsum text because those are the first two words of a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

## Delete HTML Elements
Deleting elements is very simple. All you have to do is remove everything from the opening to the closing of the element and it will be removed. No extra code is needed.

## Change the Color of Text
CSS allows us to change  many styles. To change the color of an element he use **color**.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue: `<h2 style="color: blue">CatPhotoApp</h2>`.

```
<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
