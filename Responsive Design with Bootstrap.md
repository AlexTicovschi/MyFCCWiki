## Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app just by including it with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>` at the top of your HTML.

## Make Images Mobile Responsive
When using Bootstrap, if you want an image to be responsive, all you have to do is add the class **img-responsive** to it. `<img class="img-responsive" src="http://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats">`

## Center Text with Bootstrap
Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading elements to make them look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h1 and h2 elements.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this: `<h2 class="text-red text-center">your text</h2>`.

## Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

`<button type="submit" class="btn">Like</button>`

## Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button
Normally, your button elements are only as wide as the text that they contain. By making them block elements, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space. Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

`<button class="btn btn-block">Like</button>`

## Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow
The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take. Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.

`<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button>`

## Call out Optional Actions with Button Info
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take. Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

`<button class= "btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button>`

## Warn your Users of a Dangerous Action
The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo. Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

`<button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button>`

## Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side
Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system that makes it easier to put elements into rows and tell each element's relative width.
