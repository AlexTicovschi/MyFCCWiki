## Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app just by including it with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>` at the top of your HTML.

## Make Images Mobile Responsive
When using Bootstrap, if you want an image to be responsive, all you have to do is add the class **img-responsive** to it. `<img class="img-responsive" src="http://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats">`

## Center Text with Bootstrap
Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading elements to make them look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h1 and h2 elements.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this: `<h2 class="text-red text-center">your text</h2>`.

## Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

`<button type="submit" class="btn">Like</button>`
