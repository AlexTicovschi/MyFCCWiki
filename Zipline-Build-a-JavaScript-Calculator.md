## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: [http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/full/yNBJRj](http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/full/yNBJRj).

## Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
2. You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
3. Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
1. As a user, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.
3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## Notes:
**Do not use templates for this zipline.**

CodePen.io overrides the `Window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`.

## My CSS Code Snippets
### Make things centered and styled
- Here I centered things either using `text-align` or `margins` and also gave font styling.

```css

## My JavaScript Code Snippets
### Location API callback Function
- The location API is [http://ip-api.com/json](http://ip-api.com/json) and it gets the location via `IP` address, this is the information we receive:
