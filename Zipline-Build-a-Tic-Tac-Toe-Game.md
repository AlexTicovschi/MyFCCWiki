## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: [http://codepen.io/alex-dixon/full/JogOpQ/](http://codepen.io/alex-dixon/full/JogOpQ/).

## Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
2. You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
3. Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.
1. As a user, I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
2. As a user, I can never actually win against the computer - at best I can tie.
3. As a user, my game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
4. As a user, I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Notes:
**Do not use templates for this zipline.**

CodePen.io overrides the `Window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`.

## My HTML Code Snippets
I used a table generator that I found to make the layout of the calculator using a custom table. Then I added my buttons and all the code needed.

```html

```

## My CSS Code Snippets

```css

```

## My JavaScript Code Snippets

```js
